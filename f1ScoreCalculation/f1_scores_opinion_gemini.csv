gemini,negative,i've put more hours into optimizing my inventory space in this game than i have into actually playing the main quest. it's like they intentionally made it a tetris minigame, but instead of fun shapes, it's just slightly different shades of brown armor and crafting materials. seriously, i spend half my time comparing weights and values like i'm prepping for a post-apocalyptic garage sale. and don't even get me started on the crafting system – i swear, to make a decent potion, you need a phd in virtual botany and a minor in advanced alchemy. the story is okay, i guess, but good luck remembering it between inventory management sessions. worth it? maybe, if you enjoy digital spreadsheet simulators disguised as rpgs.,0.00,0.00,0.00,0
